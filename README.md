# TwosCompliment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of this project is to implement a program that will find the two's compliment of any number using the console or dialog boxes. The program will start in dialog boxes and ask if the user wants to switch to console. Then, it will tell the user to enter a binary number and press enter or ok. Once done it will display the twos compliment. <br />
